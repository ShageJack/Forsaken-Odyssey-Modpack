## What is Forsaken Odyssey?

Forsaken Odyssey is a progressive kitchensink (just like GTNH) modpack. It mainly intends to provide players with a long-term experience of making progress in technology, which may introduce a simpler or more productive scheme of processing ores, allow players to get rid of a bunch of repetitive and complex works, improve players' survivability in this post-apocalypse world, etc. Meanwhiles, this modpack also tries to unfold a story, a picture of a forsaken world, doomed in an indescribable catastrophe, which no one was spared. Players shall find the fragment of the event and echoes from the past through their own exploration, and gradually understand what has happened on earth and also themselves, communicating with unknown entities and even greater existence, which will also be helpful in advancing their game stages, as knowledge is power.

Currently, this modpack is still at an early stage of development. And the majority of its planned content is still under construction and not ready for giving continuous and satisfactory gameplay. Content planned to show up in tiers 0, 1, 2 is nearly done, but still needs some polishing.
