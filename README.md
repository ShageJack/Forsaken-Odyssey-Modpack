# Forsaken Odyssey Modpack

Not Yet Released...

## What is Forsaken Odyssey?

Forsaken Odyssey is a progressive kitchensink (just like GTNH) modpack. It mainly intends to provide players with a long-term experience of making progress in technology, which may introduce a simpler or more productive scheme of processing ores, allow players to get rid of a bunch of repetitive and complex works, improve players' survivability in this post-apocalypse world, etc. Meanwhiles, this modpack also tries to unfold a story, a picture of a forsaken world, doomed in an indescribable catastrophe, which no one was spared. Players shall find the fragment of the event and echoes from the past through their own exploration, and gradually understand what has happened on earth and also themselves, communicating with unknown entities and even greater existence, which will also be helpful in advancing their game stages, as knowledge is power.

~~Currently, this modpack is still at an early stage of development. And the majority of its planned content is still under construction, thus, not ready for giving continuous and satisfactory gameplay. Content planned to show up in tiers 0, 1, 2 is nearly done, but still needs some polishing.~~

WE ARE CURRENTLY UPGRADING THE MINECRAFT VERSION OF THIS PACK TO 1.18.1, WHICH SHOULD BE A TOTAL REWORK. 

PLEASE HAVE PATIENCE WITH US.

## Installation

This pack is still far from done. If you want to try it out or help with developing it, you can just clone this repository and then use launchers such as MultiMC to import the modpack. 

## What does this pack have to offer?

*This part of README file is under construction.*

***Story***

Different from most other modpacks, Forsaken Odyssey has a complicated and grand background story, which is blended into gameplay in many ways. We attempt to describe a dead world that used to be vibrant, full of contradictions and struggles, misery and pain, dramatic conflicts, and even multiple revolutions, while players are silent observers to all happenings that now have been meaningless. They have faded away, covered with weeds, erased by the might of nature, only whose scars remained. 

We are just narrators. We can imply our own idea or maybe ideology in our stories, but the true message of the story will only emerge in the flood of reflection, which belongs to you people, the audience.

***Survival***

The earth was cursed and cities were ruined. Water in the rivers releases a dirty smell of dying and inevitable radiation on the surface could be fatal... If we put aside those zombies haunting and weird creatures feasting, you could also die from thirst, hunger, hypothermia, or heatstroke. Luckily, you will never actually be dead (unless you play this modpack in hardcore mode, then god bless you). The universe is fundamentally brutal, and you shall find your path to survive.

Be aware of the ruins, the legacy of the old world, in garbage dumps, and among dilapidated buildings, still, there will be something essential for your new life here yet has not decayed. For example, foods, clean water, and RadAway, a medicine to remove accumulated radiation effects.

The nature regeneration, magical recovery in vanilla Minecraft is nowhere to see. You need bandages and first-aid kits to heal yourself. Use morphine to kill pain, but be careful not to make that a suicide act.
