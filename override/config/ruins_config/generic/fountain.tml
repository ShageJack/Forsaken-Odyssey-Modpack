# TEMPLATE PARAMETER SETTINGS:
#
# criterion expression specifying mod ids required to load template
# may include plus (AND), minus (AND NOT), comma (OR), and parentheses
# all required mods listed must be present; no prohibited mods can be
requiredMods=
#
# likelihood this template will be chosen relative to all others
# e.g., a weight=6 template is chosen 3X as often as one with weight=2
weight=1
#
# list of dimensions in which this template may spawn, even if generic
# one or more dimension names, separated by commas (blank = all)
dimensionsToSpawnIn=
#
# list of other biomes in which this template may spawn
# biome corresponding to directory is always assumed, listed or not
# generic templates should leave this list empty
biomesToSpawnIn=
#
# criterion expression specifying types of biome where template spawns
# this is in addition to those explicitly listed as biomesToSpawnIn
# generic templates should leave this list empty
biomeTypesToSpawnIn=
#
# list of biomes in which this template may not spawn
# takes precedence over biomeTypesToSpawnIn, but NOT biomesToSpawnIn
# should be empty if biomeTypesToSpawnIn is empty

# depth template is pushed down into the surface when built
# offset is min/max range of random additional bury depth

# whitelist/blacklist of block types on which template may be built
# specify one, not both; leave the other empty (both empty = allow all)

# depth/height limit affected by terrain leveling
# also maximum bumpiness tolerated in surface beneath template

# expands area affected by terrain leveling (-1 = no leveling)

# minimum distance this template must have from instances of itself

# min/max distances this template can be from world spawn (0 = no limit)

# other template built nearby whenever this one is
# syntax: <name>;<relativeX>;<maxYdifference>;<relativeZ>[;<chance>]
# may be used more than once to specify multiple neighbors
